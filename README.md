# Quiz-Game
Flag Quiz Game using C# MVC (no database)


The goal of this project is to  test my ASP.NET MVC C# skills. 

*OBS*

* To show my knowledge of Repository patterns i simulated a Database by Instantiating a list of objects (hard coded)

* I left some comments in code, including TODOs, to show in which direction i was planning to evolve the application if not for the limited time

* Most of my decisions in this project took into account the need to show certains skills that might be of interest to those avaliating the project
